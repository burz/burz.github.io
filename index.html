    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello all, my name is Anthony Burzillo. I am a recent graduate of
      the Johns Hopkins University with a degree in Math and Computer
      Science. Currently, I am working at Bloomberg LP tackling problems
      concerning volatility in the ever increasing listed derivatives market.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started programming in C when I was 14, and since then I have
      dabbled in the likes of C++, Java, Python, Ruby, Objective-C,
      JavaScript, OCaml, Lisp, and Haskell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Check out some of my projects on my
      <a href="https://github.com/burz">GitHub</a>
      page. Examples include
      <a href="https://github.com/burz/feck">an interpreted language written in Ruby</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/burz/tap">a 3D game engine written in C++</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/burz/simcom">
        an interpretable and compilable (AMD64) language written in Python
      </a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/burz/slacknot">
          a homework IDE written in Ruby on Rails
      </a>,
      and
      <a href="https://github.com/burz/Feval">
        an interpreted statically typed functional langugage written in Haskell
        using f-algebras
      </a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      More recently, I've been working on a compileable, statically typed
      functional programming language written mostly in C that uses LLVM as an
      intermediate representation. Compilation almost works in all cases, but everything
      else works pretty well.

      I've also made a beer pong ranking application known as BallsApp. It can be
      found at <a href="http://www.ballsapp.com">BallsApp.com</a> as well as on the iOS
      or Android stores.
