    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello all, my name is Anthony Burzillo. I am a graduate of
      the Johns Hopkins University with a degree in Math and Computer
      Science. Currently, I am working at Bloomberg LP, tackling problems
      concerning volatility in the ever increasing listed derivatives market.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started programming in C when I was 8 at Camp Nonesuch in Natick, MA,
      creating a basic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Visual BASIC. Since then I've
      dabbled in the likes of C++, Haskell, Python, Bash, Ruby, Objective-C,
      JavaScript, OCaml, Lisp, Java, etc.

      Check out some of my projects on my

      page. Examples include
      <a href="https://github.com/burz/feck">an interpreted language written in Ruby</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/burz/tap">a 3D game engine written in C++</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/burz/simcom">
        an interpretable and compilable (AMD64) language written in Python
      </a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/burz/slacknot">
          a homework IDE written in Ruby on Rails
      </a>,
      and
      <a href="https://github.com/burz/Feval">
        an interpreted statically typed functional langugage written in Haskell
        using f-algebras
      </a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my senior year as an undergraduate, I worked on a compileable, statically typed
      functional programming language written mostly in C that uses LLVM as an
      intermediate representation. Compilation almost works in all cases, but everything
      else works pretty well.
